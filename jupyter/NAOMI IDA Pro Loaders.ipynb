    "# IDA Pro NAOMI game dump loader\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all thanks to [d0tslash](https://twitter.com/d0tslash) and [crypt0s](https://twitter.com/crypt0s) for all the talks and specifically annoying me so much that I ended up not giving up on this and actually analyzing the games for a few hours instead of a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Story\n",
    "\n",
    "d0tslash contacted me and asked me if I could start looking at arcade games late in 2018, I agreed and started to research a bit on it, got myself my first NAOMI set (which I incidentaly burned quickly) and started to check the hardware specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "I quickly realized there was not a lot of public information about games, setups and formats, even MAME's code is weird and images are \"randomly\" cut and loaded in what it appears to be static and specific addresses per game, this lead me to believe that either developers were just taking someone else's information at face value or there was some information but was kept secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while I saw a lot of information on the Dreamcast and started to check differences and information that could be the same, first of all realized that IP.BIN is technically non-existant here (it would be sort of what NetDimm is I guess) but more like the VxWorks BIOS boot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Found datasheets and programming manuals with the exact same SH4 chipset, a Dreamcast programing manual which can be found [HERE](../Programming_Manuals/SH4-SH7091_PM.pdf) (local copy) or [HERE](https://github.com/nahualito/NAOMI/blob/master/Documents/Programming_Manuals/SH4-SH7091_PM.pdf) (Github) also the datasheet for the SH4 chipset [HERE]('../Documents/SH4/SH-4%20Core%20Architecture.pdf') (local copy) or [HERE](https://github.com/nahualito/NAOMI/blob/master/Documents/SH4/SH-4%20Core%20Architecture.pdf) (Github)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on that I asked d0tslash if anyone else would know, I found some forum that had little information on \"random\" address with phrases such as \"Why do you want to know that?\" and \"If you tell me what you need I'll tell you the address\", I personally do not operate that way I know there has to be a format, there has to be a structure and I like trying to figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a while I dropped the project and moved out from California into a new job, so I stopped for a few months, on november of 2019 I retook the project and started to look at it in a new and fresh way, taking into account that I will not hit the BIOS/VxWorks directly at first but the NetDimm or the games, so stuff like the Interrupt table will not be set and barely touched by this code, so segments had to be rearranged, address tables found could not be taken as interrupt tables immediately as in my previous research with ThreadX and Android exploitation on DJI UAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "So after all the research and a brand new view I decided to automate the header loading and all for d0tslash (mainly because he would remind me I had not done it every few days :P) so we start now with the IDA Pro loader for the NAOMI/NAOMI2 game header, in particular we want the NAOMI Game header\n",
    "\n",
    "### The NAOMI game header\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains multiple strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Size | Description |\n",
    "| ---- |:-----------:|\n",
    "| 0x10 (16) |  PLATFORM |\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) |  DEV COMPANY |\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 1|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 2|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 3|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 4|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 5|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 6|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 7|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 8|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 regions, this is .. interesting although most of the last 3 are always marked as \"DEMO\" (which actually would REALLY help to bypass any region blocks :P, or left as \"clean\" depending on the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second part of the game header: RAM functions load\n",
    "\n",
    "Based also on the header starting at 0x360 (please refer into the [NAOMI GAME HEADER jupyter notebook](NAOMI%20Game%20Header.ipynb)) analysis we got some \"entries\" which have the ROM offset, the RAM address to load and the size (which is basically how much data we read from there) so we have a dictionary such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'ROM_Offset': 0x0, 'RAM_Address':0x0, 'Code_Size':0}\n",
    "\n",
    "The array ends with multiple 32 bit values of 0xFFFFFFFF, so we use that to note that we have finished reading the different arrays to be loaded alter in memory using the size to read from the offset of ROM and then loading into the RAM Address defined for every table entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Entry Address (PC) for the game appears to be in 0x420 (there is another address at 0x424 which might change and could be noted as a RESET address) and we read that value and go into the address refered in that location and execute the idaapi.add_entry(), this triggers the autoanalysis from IDA Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "You usually get around 400+ functions resolved this way, instead of manually going and baselining the ROM into the 0x0C000000 address (currently ROM is based on 0x00000000 and data copied to RAM starting at 0x0C000000 by using the RAM addresses on the tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Just loading the memory segments used\n",
    "This is the easiest way, BUT it leaves you with dangling pointers, at this point I'm just treating the ROM as data (which I shouldn't but I want to check in stages and give people a chance to actually add to them if they are interested)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried to document the code itself as much as possible but the code does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anotate the Game Header\n",
    "2. Read the 0x360 Address entries until we reach a 0xFFFFFFFF (aka -1)\n",
    "3. MakeDWord() into the address segments (so we know what it is when it gets referenced)\n",
    "4. Go to 0x420 (REALLY? REALLY!!?!?) anotate as entry point and also take 0x424 as the debug entry address (AKA NAOMI went into debug mode)\n",
    "5. Cross fingers and hope it works :P\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the entire SH4 segments\n",
    "To create the segments first we have to go into the dataseet, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/nahualito/NAOMI)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at page 52 of the document we can see the external memory address space in which is actually segmented:\n",
    "\n",
    "![External Memory Address Space](images/ExternalMemorySpace.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we also need to check the physical address spaces, this is because I/O requests, interrupts and ROM segments are defined in the physical space (specially the RESET and POWER ON interrupts setup by the BIOS and the I/O segments)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Physicall Memory Address Space](images/PhysicalAddressSpace.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The loader executes this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anotate the Game Header\n",
    "2. Create the SH4 default segments\n",
    "2. Read the 0x360 Address entries until we reach a 0xFFFFFFFF (aka -1)\n",
    "3. MakeDWord() into the address segments (so we know what it is when it gets referenced)\n",
    "4. Go to 0x420 (REALLY? REALLY!!?!?) anotate as entry point and also take 0x424 as debug entry address\n",
    "5. For each of the address entries read in the defined table at 0x360 copy the data from the offset of the ROM, to the RAM address with the size already defined (Please see the NAOMI Game Header notebook for more information on that)\n",
    "6. Read the address on the 0x420 address and go into that address and mark that as \"_start\" for autoanalysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install\n",
    "Simply move into the loaders folder in your IDA Pro installation (this is based on python 3, so make sure you have IDA 7.0 and above!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note\n",
    "\n",
    "![Load Binary menu](images/LoadBinaryMenu.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO\n",
