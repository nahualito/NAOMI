    "# IDA Pro NAOMI game dump loader\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all thanks to [d0tslash](https://twitter.com/d0tslash) and [crypt0s](https://twitter.com/crypt0s) for all the talks and specifically annoying me so much that I ended up not giving up on this and actually analyzing the games for a few hours instead of a few minutes.\n",

    "foobar\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start now with the IDA Pro loader for the NAOMI/NAOMI2 game header, in particular we want the NAOMI Game header\n",
    "\n",
    "### The NAOMI game header\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains multiple strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Size | Description |\n",
    "| ---- |:-----------:|\n",
    "| 0x10 (16) |  PLATFORM |\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) |  DEV COMPANY |\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 1|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 2|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 3|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 4|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 5|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 6|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 7|\n",
    "| 0x20 (32) | TITLE + REGION 8|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 regions, this is .. interesting although most of the last 3 are always marked as \"DEMO\" (which actually would REALLY help to bypass any region blocks :P, or left as \"clean\" depending on the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "based also on the header starting at 0x360 (please refer into the NAOMI GAME HEADER jupyter notebook) analysis we got some \"entries\" which have the ROM offset, the RAM address to load and the size (which is basically how much data we read from there)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Just loading the memory segments used\n",
    "This is the easiest way, BUT it leaves you with dangling pointers, at this point I'm just treating the ROM as data (which I shouldn't but I want to check in stages and give people a chance to actually add to them if they are interested)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried to document the code itself as much as possible but the code does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anotate the Game Header\n",
    "2. Read the 0x360 Address entries until we reach a 0xFFFFFFFF (aka -1)\n",
    "3. MakeDWord() into the address segments (so we know what it is when it gets referenced)\n",
    "4. Go to 0x420 (REALLY? REALLY!!?!?) anotate as entry point and also take 0x424 as RESET vector address\n",
    "5. Cross fingers and hope it works :P\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the entire SH4 segments\n",
    "To create the segments first we have to go into the dataseet, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/nahualito/NAOMI)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at page 52 of the document we can see the external memory address space in which is actually segmented:\n",
    "\n",
    "![External Memory Address Space](images/ExternalMemorySpace.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we also need to check the physical address spaces, this is because I/O requests, interrupts and ROM segments are defined in the physical space (specially the RESET and POWER ON interrupts setup by the BIOS and the I/O segments)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Physicall Memory Address Space](images/PhysicalAddressSpace.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The loader executes this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anotate the Game Header\n",
    "2. Create the SH4 default segments\n",
    "2. Read the 0x360 Address entries until we reach a 0xFFFFFFFF (aka -1)\n",
    "3. MakeDWord() into the address segments (so we know what it is when it gets referenced)\n",
    "4. Go to 0x420 (REALLY? REALLY!!?!?) anotate as entry point and also take 0x424 as RESET vector address\n",
    "5. For each of the address entries read in the defined table at 0x360 copy the data from the offset of the ROM, to the RAM address with the size already defined (Please see the NAOMI Game Header notebook for more information on that)\n",
    "6. Read the address on the 0x420 address and go into that address and mark that as \"_start\" for autoanalysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to install\n",
    "Simply move into the loaders folder in your IDA Pro installation (this is based on python 3, so make sure you have IDA 7.0 and above!)\n",
